# lineament-extraction-python
A new algorithm for spatial clustering of the line segments as a tool for lineament extraction.

The lineament is a linear feature describing discontinuity in a landscape. The lineament extraction is not an easy problem. Recently, an automatic approach based on multi-hillshade hierarchic clustering has been developed. An important part of this approach is the spatial line segment clustering. This paper presents a new algorithm for this clustering, based on a facility location algorithm. The results of implementation show acceleration in comparison with its predecessor.

* Requirements: python3 

* Usage:
    ``$python3 __main__.py [-h] <input file path> <border X> <border Y> <output file path>``
    
* Where:
    ``<input file path>``  - path to input file
    ``<border X>``         - width of buffer zone
    ``<border Y>``         - height of buffer zone
    ``<border azimuth>``   - azimuth threshold
    ``<output file path>`` - path to output file
    
* Example:
    ``$python3 __main__.py C:\Data\input.txt 150 200 20 C:\Data\result.txt``
